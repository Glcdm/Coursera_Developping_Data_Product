This shiny project is about prediction miles per gallon on the mtcars dataset

The regression model is based on three inputs :

* am (Transmission : Manual or Automatic)

* wt (Weight (1000 lbs))

* qsec (1/4 mile time)

The user can modify those three inputs and the application will give you the estimated Miles per gallon
